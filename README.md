IPFS Live Streaming
===================

This project is started by [@ASoTNetworks](https://github.com/ASoTNetworks) and [@darkdrgn2k](https://github.com/darkdrgn2k) to stream videos over IPFS, which overlapped with the need to live stream the [Our Networks 2018](https://ournetworks.ca) conference in Toronto. We will document here the components and processes necessary to run live streams throughout the conference and archive the video assets on the IPFS network, that is suitable for a small conference with an audience size of less than 100 people.
